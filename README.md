# Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship Task 2

Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis on a dataset, such as analyzing the Titanic dataset to discover insights about the survival of passengers.

### Task Completed

This submission fulfills the requirements of Task 2, which was to perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA). I analyzed the **Titanic dataset** to uncover key insights related to passenger survival based on various factors such as gender, class, and fare.

### Methodology:

- **Data Acquisition:** The Titanic dataset was sourced from the seaborn library.
- **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values in the age and embarked columns and removed unnecessary columns like cabin.
- **Data Analysis:** Explored survival factors such as age, gender, class, and fare using Python’s visualization libraries.
- **Key Insights:**
  - Females had a higher survival rate, reflecting the "women and children first" policy.
  - Class 3 passengers had the lowest survival rate, highlighting the effect of socio-economic status.
  - Strong correlations between fare, gender, and survival outcomes.

### Visualizations:

- **Bar Charts and Count Plots:** Used to visualize survival ratios across gender, class, and age categories.
- **Heatmap:** Displayed the correlations between different features and survival.
- **Pie Charts:** Created to visualize the overall survival ratio as well as survival ratios for males and females.

### Tools and Libraries:

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
